        #1: Hosting and Domain?{" "}
      </h1>
      <h2 className="font-bold py-3 text-lg">A - Domain</h2>
      <p>
        A domain is the human-readable address that people use to access your
        website. It's what you type into the web browser's address bar to visit
        a specific website. For example, "www.example.com" is a domain name.
        It's composed of a second-level domain (like "example") and a top-level
        domain (like ".com").

      <h2 className="font-bold py-3 text-lg">B - Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        Web hosting is the service that allows your website to be accessible on
        the internet. When you have a website, it consists of various files,
        images, and code. These files need to be stored on a server (a powerful
        computer) that is connected to the internet and accessible 24/7. This is
        where hosting comes in.
