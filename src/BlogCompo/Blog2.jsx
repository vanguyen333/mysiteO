        <strong>What exactly is Web 1.0?</strong>
        <br />
        Web 1.0 is considered the first stage of the World Wide Web where users
        have limited interaction with websites. During this era, websites
        typically featured static content presented through simple HTML pages.
        Users have limited opportunities to engage or interact on these early
        websites.

        <br />
        <strong>How about Web 2.0?</strong>
        <br />
        The websites we are using basically Web 2.0. It refers to the
        21st-century Internet applications that have transformed the digital era
        in the aftermath of the dotcom bubble. The term Web 2.0 first came into
        use in 1999 as the Internet pivoted toward a system that actively
        engaged the user. Users were encouraged to provide content, rather than
        just viewing it. The social aspect of the Internet has been particularly
        transformed; in general, social media allows users to engage and
        interact with one another by sharing thoughts, perspectives, and
        opinions. Users can tag, share, tweet, and like.[1]

        <strong>What is Web 3.0?</strong>
        <br />
        With the introduction of advanced technologies, Web 3.0 is expected to
        take over the Internet in the near future. Web 3.0 allows users to take
        control over their private data, which makes the web more secure.
        <br />
        The core of Web 3.0 is blockchain technology which is decentralized and
        distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple
        computers in a secure and transparent manner. it consists of a chain of
        blocks, where each block contains a group of transactions, each block is
        linked to the previous one using cryptographic principles. For more
