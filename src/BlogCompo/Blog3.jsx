        #3 How 'GRATEFUL' can lead to Happiness?
      </h1>
      <p className="pt-4">
        Grateful itself is a positive thing. Whenever I start a day with the
        first thinking of how grateful I am to what I have and will have will
        always makes me feel happy and blessed.
        <br />
        The reason is because when our mind feels grateful - which is a positive
        state of mind, our body's circulation generate more positive thinking,
        we attract more great things come to life. Good things originated from
        good thoughts. <br />
        <br />A significant research has been made from
        <strong> Dr.Masaru Emoto </strong>
        regarding how water behaves when being exposed to thoughts and words.
        <br />
        <br />
        Water is frozen then pictures being taken of the resultant crystals
        before and after doing something on it for the purpose of comparision ,
        and the result blows people away. He play diffirent kinds of music and
        take photograpsh for each music type. Classical music generates
        well-shaped crystals but heavy metal songs produced misshapen, irregular
        cystals. Positive words being said on water produces beautiful crystals
        and negative words produce the oppositive result.
