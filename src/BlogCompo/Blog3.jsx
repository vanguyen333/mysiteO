        #3 How 'GRATEFUL' can lead to Happiness?
      </h1>
      <p className="pt-4">
        Grateful itself is a positive affirmation. Commencing each day by
        acknowledging my gratitude for present and future blessings consistently
        engenders feelings of joy and a sense of being blessed.
        <br />
        The reason is because embracing gratitude initiates a positive mental
        state, our body stimuates a surge of optimistic thoughts within our
        mind. This consequently influences our body's circulation, fostering and
        environment to attracting more favorable outcomes. Positive ideas beget
        positive outcomes. <br />

        Water is frozen then pictures being taken of the resultant crystals
        before and after doing something on it for the purpose of comparision ,
        and the result blows people away. He played diffirent kinds of music and
        took photograpsh for each music type. Classical music generated
        well-shaped crystals but heavy metal songs produced misshapen, irregular
        cystals. Positive words being said on water produced beautiful crystals
        and negative words produced the oppositive result.
